# Datastructs_Algs_2

The second of two labs completed for the intro to Datastructures & Algorithms course at KU Leuven. In this lab we use the principles of dynamic programming to efficiently implement our own particular type of grid-pathfinder from the ground up. The description and abstraction of the problem, a step-by-step explanation of the discovery of a possible efficient algorithm and an extensive analysis of the time & space complexity at each step are written down in a [report](https://github.com/Ferrevdv/Datastructs_Algs_2/blob/main/report.pdf). As a bonus we complicate the initial problem at the end to demonstrate the flexibility and strength of our dynamic programming approach.
